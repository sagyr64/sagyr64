        "In recent years, the use of machine learning, and deep learning, in pharmaceutical research has shown promising results in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. In this talktorial, we get familiar with the basics of neural networks. We will learn how to build a simple two layer neural network and train it on a subset of ChEMBL data in order to predict the pIC50 values of compounds against EGFR, the target of interest. Furthermore, we select three compounds from an external, unlabeled data set that are predicted to be the most active against that kinase."

This optimization scheme is iterative and uses both the derivative of the loss function (or gradient in the multivariate case) and a learning rate. The main idea behind the algorithm is to follow the steepest direction of the function, obtained with the gradient and managing the length of each step with the learning rate.

        "- **Define the model** - In keras, every ANN is represented by keras [models](https://keras.io/api/models/model/#model-class). Keras provides a way to create a model which is called [sequential](https://keras.io/api/models/sequential/). The layers are arranged sequentially where the data flows from one layer to another layer in a given order until the data finally reaches the output layer. Each layer in the ANN can be represented by a *keras layer*.\n",

        "- **Compile the model** − The compilation is the final step in creating a model. Once the compilation is done, we can move on to the training phase. A _loss function_ and an _optimizer_ are required in the learning phase to define the prediction error and to minimize it, respectively. In the practical part of this talktorial, we use the mean squared error as a loss and the [adam](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/) optimizer, which is a popular version of gradient descent and has shown to give good results in a wide range of problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fit the model** - The actual learning process will be done in this phase using the training data set. We can call the [fit()](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) method which needs several parameters such as $x$ the input data, $y$ the target data, the batch size, the number of epochs, etc. An _epoch_ is when the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network once.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Evaluate model** − We can evaluate the model by looking at the loss function between the predicted and true values of the test data using the [evaluate()](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#evaluate-method) method.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Scatter plots are a common and simple approach to visualize the evaluation of a model. They plot the predicted vs. true values. If the fit was perfect, we should see the $y=x$ line, meaning that the predicted value is exactly the true value.\n",
